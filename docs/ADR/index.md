# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains the project's ADRs. Each ADR file in this directory contains front-matter with `parent: Architecture Decision Records` and a `nav_order` so the site navigation and sidebar are generated automatically.

Browse the ADRs from the site navigation â€” new ADRs will appear automatically when added to this folder (use `scripts/new_adr.sh` to create them).
